    Hello! Thanks for stopping by my personal website.
</p>
<p>
    I'm Zain Chohan. I'm a Front End Developer with a focus on modern web technologies. I specialize in JavaScript and its ecosystem—particularly React, Next.js, and TypeScript—and I love building responsive, accessible, and performant user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    My main languages are JavaScript and TypeScript. I work with React and Next.js for building web applications, and I use tools like Tailwind CSS, Figma, and Git in my day-to-day work. I'm always learning and keeping up with front-end best practices and new technologies.
</p>
<p>
    I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and putting users first—whether that's through performance, accessibility, or clear design.
</p>
<p>
    I'm good at adapting to different situations, working efficiently, and collaborating with teams. I'm excited about the chance to work together and build great front-end experiences!
</p>
<p>
    I'm looking forward to the possibility of working with you!
</p>
